# Hardware-Final-Exam-SOLUTION WRITEUP

Components Explanation:
- For my controller, I made 2 components - the base and the lid. The base acts as the container to hold all of the electronic components such as the joystick, the two buttons, the LED, the breadboard and the arduino. The lid has multiple holes for the joystick, LED and the two buttons to slot in place as well. 

Assembly Explanation: 
- To assemble the controller, the main  electronic circuits such as the arduino and the breadboard are located in the central bottom part of the base. The joystick is one the left and the two buttons are on the right. The user can use the joystick to move, and the two buttons act as a dodge and an attack. The LED will also light up if the user has performed action by clicking either button. 

TinkerCAD Explanation:
- For the schematic, you can press the buttons to light up the LED simulating the buttons that the user would be pressing on the controller.
